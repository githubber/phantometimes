<h1>Phantome Times</h1>

<p>Thanks for buying my theme. It is a theme for news heavy websites, tending more to be useful for professional publishing. It as custom theme
 for <a href="http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/">Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>To download, visit the <a href="https://creativemarket.com/Starburst1977/96557-Phantome-Times/">theme page</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Phantome Times should actually work out of the box. I recommend you set up your Ghost blog completely, adding users with images and descriptions. Afterwards, go ahead and publish articles (I recommend to use the article images feature from Ghost 0.5.2 for all articles). Articles that are more important that others and useful beyond tomorrow can be &ldquo;starred&rdquo; inside the Ghost editor and will get listed inside the &ldquo;Featured articles&rdquo; list on the index page.</p>

<p>If have added a two locations for custom information, if you wish to add links to static pages or other stuff. I added comments to this particular locations, so you can find them easily (inside default.hbs and index.hbs).</p>

<p>The article view sidebar will become more useful (besides showing the author information) as Ghost progresses and offers more options (like the most popular articles&hellip;). I will update the theme accordingly.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or problems, I recommend dropping me mail at me@svenread.com.</p>
